                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                    <p class="mb-5" style="font-weight: bold;">2. Membership :</p>
                    Following the submission of the necessary information to Dealsandcouponsmena, our membership is accessible through the registration process. We make our most recent Terms and Conditions available to you during registration.
                    The running of sponsored advertisements referring to Dealsandcouponsmena on Google, Facebook, or any other platform is not permitted for members of Dealsandcouponsmena, so please be aware of this. The member's account will be immediately terminated if they don't follow these rules.

                    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Cashback Service :</li>

                    <p class="mb-5">Users who register on the Platform ("Members") and then open an account with us ("Account") are able to use our Cashback Service to get cashback on tracked purchases made from Platform sellers ("Retailers"). A "Qualifying Transaction"—a purchase that has been tracked, authenticated, and successfully completed—must be made by the Member to be eligible for cashback, and the cashback that results must be received by us before it can be considered "Cashback."
                        If the Retailers fail to use their affiliate monitoring system to log a transaction, then such sales may not be paid to Dealsandcouponsmena, and as a result, any owed or anticipated cashback from these sales will also not be paid to the Member.
                    </p>

                    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Unique Referral Fee :</li>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                        As long as they continue to be members, the Dealsandcouponsmena Service offers its users a special referral bonus in which they receive 2% cashback on any new members they bring on board using the platform's instructions (a "Qualifying Referral"). Please refer to Clause 5 for more information.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5" style="font-weight: bold;">4. Joining the Group :</p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                        If you are a natural person, you must be 18 (eighteen) years of age or older in order to use the platform. Additionally, by using the platform or accepting these terms and conditions, you represent and warrant to Dealsandcouponsmena that you are at least 18 (eighteen) years old, that you have the right, authority, and capacity to use the platform, and that you agree to and abide by these terms and conditions. You must provide accurate and up-to-date information about yourself when signing up for the Cashback Service, including your legal name, address, and any other information that may be required. When asked for information about a bank account, check payment information, or another payment method (your "Cashback Receipt Method") into which you wish to receive payments, you must (a) ensure that you are, and will continue to be, fully authorized to use that Cashback Receipt Method and (b) confirm that you wish to receive cashback through that Cashback Receipt Method. Through your Account, you should keep this information current. Please be aware that there are an additional Rs 30 administration fee for Cashback payments made by cheque.
                        If the Retailers fail to use their affiliate monitoring system to log a transaction, then such sales may not be paid to Dealsandcouponsmena, and as a result, any owed or anticipated cashback from these sales will also not be paid to the Member.
                        The User's affirmative consent is required for the generation and collection of "Sensitive Personal Data or Information" in line with the Information Technology Act, 2000, as modified from time to time and allied rules. The User grants consent to the generation and collection of information as necessary to comply with applicable laws by indicating assent to this Policy by clicking the "I Agree with Terms and Policy" button at the time of registration.
                        Be aware that the maximum or minimum payment you can get through your chosen Cashback Receipt Method (such as Net banking, Cheque, Gift Cards, or other payment methods We may provide) may be governed by certain limitations.
                        We will send you crucial messages there, so please make sure that the email address and mobile number we have on file for you are accurate and that you have access to them. You must update the information we have on file for you on your Account if your email address or mobile number changes.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5" style="font-weight: bold;">5. Cashback and Referral Fees :</p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                        We transfer the Cashback to the Member through his or her Cashback Receipt Method after a Member completes a Qualifying Transaction successfully and after we have acquired the Cashback for that Qualifying Transaction.
                        Please be aware that under certain conditions, a transaction with a retailer may not qualify as a qualifying transaction or may not result in Cashback. Similarly, a Qualifying Referral qualifies as such. The Member is aware that all of his/her transactions are with the specific Retailer, not with us. We have further details regarding these situations on our support sites. The commission paid by Retailers may also change from time to time, in which case the cashback offer depicted on our Platform may not be accurate. By default, your related transactions will be credited in accordance with the commission that the Retailer reports to us; this commission may be greater or lower than the rate that was advertised. Any discrepancy between the member's anticipated cashback and the cashback the member actually receives is not our responsibility.
                        A "waiting payment" will be credited to your account after we have linked a paying, qualifying transaction to it. The payment will be marked as "verified" once the Retailer approves the transaction; this could take 90 days or longer from the date of the purchase. The cashback payment will not be given if the items are returned, the sale is reversed, or the transaction is altered in any way. Members must inform Dealsandcouponsmena of any returns or exchanges for which they may have improperly earned rewards in addition to the Retailer.
                        The Member acknowledges and accepts that the Retailer or us may determine whether a transaction qualifies as a Qualifying for cashback Transaction (including cashback through a Qualifying Referral) at their sole discretion. If the Retailer does not notify us of a sale or does not classify a transaction as a qualifying transaction, we will not be held liable. Furthermore, we shall not be liable if, for any reason, it is impossible for us to attribute a sale to a Member and the transaction is not eligible to be considered a qualifying transaction or a qualifying referral. While we will make every effort to get the Retailer to pay up, the final say in any matter belongs to us, the Retailer, or the tracking agent for the Retailer. Even while we will make every effort to recover any lost commissions, we reserve the right to not pursue such claims if no transaction has been made.
                        Additionally, the Member will not earn any Cashback if the Retailer believes that the purchase is not legitimate for any reason at all and we do not receive any Cashback for the transaction.
                        When a member contacts us with a question about missing cashback, our system looks to see if the user left our platform on the day the Member specifies. The Member will see a notification stating that they did not navigate via our website to earn cashback prior to the sale if no exit clicks can be tracked. The database retains all store exit clicks for cross-referencing and adding cashback values. You might receive less money than you anticipated when a commission inquiry has been paid successfully by a retailer since the money, we received may have been less than what was originally claimed. You are welcome to ask us questions about this. We reserve the right to close the inquiry claim if a Retailer hasn't paid a manual commission claim after six months. Only when the Retailer pays Dealsandcouponsmena is any payout for Missing Cashback relevant.
                        When it is clear that credit was applied improperly, we reserve the right to reclaim it or amend the balance accordingly. This covers, but is not limited to, transactions where the credit is not actually due, where payment for any credited transaction has not been received from a Retailer or its agencies, as well as instances of fraud or misuse. This can apply to transactions that have already been paid to you by Net banking, Cheque, Gift Cards, or any other payment method that We may occasionally implement. These transactions may already be shown as payable or validated in your Account. In all such cases, Dealsandcouponsmena has the right to recoup all cashback that was improperly paid but to which the member was not entitled to earn, through legal proceedings.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                        There are a number of situations in which Cashback will not be paid to the Member and will instead be forfeited to us, including but not limited to:
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                        <b>A.</b> In the event that the cashback payment we receive cannot be linked to a Qualifying Transaction or an Account (such as where the Member is not logged-in to our Platform when making the relevant purchase). <br>

                        <b>B.</b> The transaction that the Cashback pertains to is canceled after it has been entered into (either through the right of cancellation that some sales conducted at a distance are subject to, or otherwise), and the Cashback is allocated to a member or Account that has been: <br>

                    <p class="mb-5" style="color: red;">
                        When you have at least 10 AED in your account, you can withdraw your validated cashback. The entire sum would be lost if the Member chooses to close their account with us and the verified cashback in their account at the time of closure is less than 10 AED. You can request payment of the verified cashback by any of the cashback receipt methods if the amount is 10 AED or more in your account. The cost of cashback payments made via check is an additional 2 AED. Our Bank levies this fee to support administrative and postal expenses. Any such verified balance that appears on your Account may be forfeited at our discretion for the reasons detailed herein in this Agreement.

                    <p class="mb-5">
                        We do not engage in business with Retailers, and we do not sell or supply any of the products or services that they offer. As a result, we are exempt from all the obligations imposed by law on providers of those goods and services.
                        As a result, we are not in charge of or accountable for: <br>

                        <b>A.</b> the standard, security, or legality of the products or services offered by retailers; or <br>
                        <b>B.</b> Whether the retailer can or will deliver any products or services and transmit good title to them.<br>

                        Members should use the same level of caution online as they would in an offline transaction while engaging in transactions with Retailers. You release us, our agents, and employees from any liability arising from or connected with any transactions with Retailers, to the extent that the Applicable Law permits, including (without limitation) all claims and demands relating to incomplete or completed transactions with Retailers, or goods or services offered for sale or supply, or actually sold or supplied, through or in connection with any transactions with Retailers.

                    <p class="mb-5">
                        If in our reasonable opinion, the relevant Member or Account appears to be in violation of any provision of this Agreement, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate that Member's access to all or part of our service.
                        Members must not engage in, or attempt to engage in, any transaction with a Retailer or to obtain Cashback (a) by providing personal information of another person or a payment method that they are not authorized to use, (b) by unfairly or deceptively utilizing a Retailer's offering, including but not limited to creating fake or unauthorized referral links, or (c) in violation of any terms and conditions applied by us or the Retailer to that transaction. If a member abuses our service in this way, we reserve the right to cancel any pending or validated payments in the Member's Account.
                        Each Member is responsible for making sure that any content they upload or that is connected to their account:<br>

Any Member who, in the sole judgment of the Retailer or us, misused the Platform or our Cashback Service or engaged in fraudulent activity while using it will have their Account closed,
                        their email and IP address will be blacklisted to prevent future use, and they will not be permitted to register from the same PC. <br>
                        Please use our contact form to let us know if you notice anything on our Platform that looks to violate any of the aforementioned guidelines. <br>

                        Occasionally, we or our partners may offer new or improved services through the Platform. Additional terms and conditions may apply while using those services, and you must abide by them. Any violation by you of a substantial term of the conditions governing such services shall constitute a breach of this Agreement,
                        provided that those terms are properly disclosed to you on the Platform when you agree to use those services (as determined by us in our reasonable discretion).<br>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                        When there are legal, security, technological, or business reasons to do so, we reserve the right to discontinue, alter, or suspend all or a portion of the Cashback Service. Except in cases where it is necessary to act sooner for security reasons or because of technical issues that might otherwise negatively impair our service, we will try to give you 30 days' notice before taking such action. The Cashback Service might occasionally become unavailable due to technical issues we encounter or issues with the Internet, but we'll take reasonable steps to solve these issues when they're within our control.
                        Though we try our best, we can't promise that the Cashback Service or any of the content on it will always be available.
                        However, we will make every effort to limit any scheduled outage periods; these will be disclosed to you when you visit the Cashback Service at the appropriate time.
                        We may ask you to alter your password or other details that enable access to the Cashback Service for security or other reasons, but we'll never ask you for your password over the phone, via email, or through any other channel than the Platform. The confidentiality of your password and any other identifying information is your exclusive responsibility.<br>

                        Your whole understanding with us regarding the Cashback Service is meant to be contained in this Agreement, which we deem to be fair and reasonable.

                    <p class="mb-5">
                        This Agreement may be modified from time to time, and the updated version will be posted on the Cashback Service. When we do, we will update these terms and conditions and post a new version of the Agreement on the Cashback Service. This new version will govern the Cashback Service and our relationship with you:
                        A. If any changes are made to an operative provision of this Agreement that could have an adverse effect on you, they will take effect no later than three days after the date of posting (or the later date we specify in the relevant posting); if you do not wish to be governed by the new version of the Agreement, you may notify us on or before the date when the new version of the Agreement is to take effect, and from that date, you must stop using our service. Or
                        B. If the changes do not affect any operative provisions or are not likely to have an adverse effect on you, they will take effect immediately after posting (or at the later time we specify in the relevant posting), for instance, if the contact information for the referenced party’s changes or existing provisions are refined.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5" style="font-weight: bold;">21. General :</p>
                    <p class="mb-5">
                        The remainder of this Agreement shall remain legal and enforceable even if any term is found to be invalid or unenforceable. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employee-employer relationship is intended or created by this Agreement; you and we are independent contractors. We may nonetheless take legal action in response to later or similar breaches even if we choose not to respond to a breach by you or someone else.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5" style="font-weight: bold;">22. Governing Law :</p>
